* `handleRequest` method of the `Handler` class is called when I update the url. 
* The relevant arguments are the new URIs with updated `s=<string>` and `user=<string>` which update the `chat` instance field that is updated and returned everytime the correct arguments are passed. In my case, I used `s=how are you` and `user=yash`
* The `chat` instance field added `yash: how are you\n` to the end of the string.

## Part 3
&nbsp;I learned from week 3 lab about ssh and how to copy files over using scp. It was cool that you can just copy over a key to never have to login using a password again. I learned how to set git bash as my default terminal as I already have been working with VSCode but never knew you could do that.

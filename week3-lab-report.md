* `handleRequest` method of the `Handler` class is called when I update the url. 
* The relevant arguments are using `s=<string>` and `user=<string>` which update the `chat` instance field that is updated and returned everytime the correct arguments are passed. In my case, I used `s=how are you` and `user=yash`
* The `chat` instance field added `yash: how are you\n` to the end of the string.

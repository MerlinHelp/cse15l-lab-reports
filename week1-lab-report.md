# Lab Report Week 1

```
# Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
# Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
# Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

# So that's 9 total examples (3 for each command). For each, include:

# A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
* What the working directory was when the command was run
* A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
* Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error.
```
